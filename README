From wikipedia:
The Bar-tailed Godwit (Limosa lapponica) is a large wader in the family Scolopacidae, which breeds on Arctic coasts and tundra mainly in the Old World, and winters on coasts in temperate and tropical regions of the Old World. Its migration is the longest known non-stop flight of any bird and also the longest journey without pausing to feed by any animal.

A godwit can fly for thousands of kilometers withouth rest. This programs aims to manage long tracks stored as GPX files, so there is a natural assonance with godwits. Moreover, it aspires to be as wit (read smart, sharp) as god.
